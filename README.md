# roguelikeProto

A prototype roguelike game for my Computer Science A-level project.
Made using the Monogame framework - an open source implementation of microsoft's depreceated XNA framework.

Features procedurally generated worlds using perlin noise,
A* algorithm pathfinding for mobile objects (mobs),
Sprites completley stolen from other games as i suck at art,
Full dynamic hierarchical UI system (WIP).

I'm struggling to think of a name for this game, my initial idea was Ro-land (after my dog, Roland)
