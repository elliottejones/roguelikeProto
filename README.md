# The Rec

# Update 20th July:
I finished the game a few weeks before deadline, I had plenty of time to finish my write-up and do some final bug fixes!
I scored 70/77, which was the second highest in my college!

# About:

Made using the Monogame framework - an open source implementation of microsoft's depreceated XNA framework.

Named after a real park that is only slightly less deadly than this game.

Basically, a load of angry animals run at you in an infinite grassy archipelago until eventually there are too many to kill and you die.

Features procedurally generated worlds using perlin noise,
A* algorithm pathfinding for mobile objects (mobs),
Sprites completley stolen from other games as i suck at art,
Infinite rounds (technically)
Full dynamic hierarchical UI system (WIP).

This steaming pile of atrocious code has been the bane of my life for the past year, feels good to be finally getting rid of it from my life.
